description="The originators of the phrase, 'sugar, spice, and everything nice, that's what little girls are made of.' Not because they believed it, but because it served as a rather nice cover for their younger recruits. These Amazon warriors have turned toward a darker side of magic, donning cloaks of black and purple. It should be noted that they have a rather kick-ass headquarters which is open to the public on tuesday."
