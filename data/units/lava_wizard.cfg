description="Completely the opposite of the introspective fire wizard, the lava wizard enjoys making things explode with the power of magma! However, active volcanoes being few and far between, they are usually just found looking at National Geographics in a dark corner of the library. They wear a brick-lined hat to protect against falling lava and rocks. Whenever a major eruption occurs, they will generally evacuate any near-by villages. A hallmark of theirs during an eruption is 'half the wizards running away in terror, half the wizards running to in anticipation."
