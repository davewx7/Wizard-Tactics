description="Pottery, clay sculptures, and the occasional golem are the products of the humble Earth Monk. They build little shacks by a nice source of raw material and produce crafts and goods which they sell by the road to travellers. Of course, being so solitary, they can also get away with magic no one else can. Be wary of an earth monk at war - they want to end it quickly, so they can get back to their nice peaceful pottery wheel."
