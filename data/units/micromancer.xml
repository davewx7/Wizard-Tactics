description="Through the use of circular light-distorting magical fields, these wizards have learned to apply magic on the smaller scales. They usually take on a green hue, since, to quote the movement founder, 'Photosyntheses is just a blast, and you don't have to worry about rickets!' Saner heads have debated whether this is true, or if it just helps them not kill each other on the battlefield and that the whole bit about photosyntheses is a load of hot air."
